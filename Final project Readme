Instructions for how to run the code:

the files needed to run this file are M V plotGraphs baseplot and beamGui.
The main function to run the whole thing is beamGui. This calls on baseplot 
to run the function that makes the beam, and it calls V and M to calculate the
two arrays for them and then plots them underneath the original beam plot.
