Instructions for how to run the code:

the files needed to run this file are M V plotGraphs baseplot and beamGui.
There are ones like it labeled original to show the code that my E-bodies professor gave 
me to start with but they have nothing to do with my end function. 
The main function  to run the whole thing is beamGui. This calls on baseplot 
to run the function that makes the beam, and it calls V and M to calculate the
two arrays for their values and then plots them against a simple array underneath the original beam plot.
